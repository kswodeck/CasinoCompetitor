# GameChanger

Welcome to my project, currently called "Game Changer". This is a virtual casino type of web app where luck and chance is the calling card.
Features include a virtual coin flipper, virtual dice rolling (up to 20 dice) as well as virtual 5 card poker

Enhancements are still in progress, specifically for the virtual poker feature, which I am calling "Poker Partner"
Poker Partner has the functionalities of a standard video poker game, but also offers your own personalized poker trainer.
With strategy mode turn on, Poker Partner will evaluate the hand you are dealt and advise you on the best move(s) to make, which cards to hold, in order to acheive the highest win possible.
Poker Partner can also show you the percentages of winning each type of poker hand based on what cards you have held, ensuring that you understand the stakes before the final redeal is done.
